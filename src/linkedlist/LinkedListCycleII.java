 * 142. Linked List Cycle II
 * Given the head of a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.
 * There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously
 * following the next pointer. Internally, pos is used to denote the index of the node that tail's next pointer
 * is connected to (0-indexed). It is -1 if there is no cycle.
 * Note that pos is not passed as a parameter.
